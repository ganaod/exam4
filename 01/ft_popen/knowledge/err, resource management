err & resource management

system err handling:
.pipe() fail: no fildes available
.fork() fail: no mem/processes
.dup2 fail: invalid descriptors
.execvp fail: cmd not found 

fildes management:
.crucial to close unnecessary descriptors
.avoid leaks
.close in correct order to avoid deadlocks 

zombie processes:
.this implementation doesn't handle wait()
.in complete implementation, would need ft_pclose
.store PIDs to wait() for them later
