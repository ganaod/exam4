"Which remote to throw away?"

After fork(), BOTH processes have ALL file descriptors:
// After fork(), BOTH parent and child have:
// fds[0] (read end)
// fds[1] (write end)
// stdin (fd 0) 
// stdout (fd 1)

The pattern:

	Child: Keeps what it needs for the tool program, closes the rest
	Parent: Keeps what it needs for communication, closes the rest
