close() doesn't "remove" - it removes YOUR reference:
Think reference counting:
c// After dup2(fds[0], STDIN_FILENO):
// The pipe object has THREE references pointing to it:
// - fds[0] (original reference)  
// - stdin (fd 0) (new reference via dup2)
// - fds[1] (write end, different part of same pipe)

close(fds[0]);  // Removes ONE reference (the original fds[0])
// Pipe object still exists! stdin (fd 0) still points to it
// Tool program will read from stdin, which now points to pipe
Analogy: Like having multiple remote controls for one TV. Throwing away one remote doesn't destroy the TV - other remotes still work.
