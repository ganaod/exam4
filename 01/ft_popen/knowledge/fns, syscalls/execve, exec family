EXECVP vs EXEC FAMILY:
- execvp() searches PATH automatically
- Uses argument array (safer than system())
- Completely replaces process image



Process image = the loaded program in memory:

Before exec: Child process is running a copy of YOUR program
After exec: Child process is running the TOOL program (wc)
execvp() completely replaces the program code, but keeps PID and file descriptors

execvp breakdown:

exec = execute (replace current program)
v = vector (arguments as array: ["wc", "-l", NULL])
p = PATH (search in PATH environment variable)

Alternative forms: execl(), execle(), execve() - different argument formats
