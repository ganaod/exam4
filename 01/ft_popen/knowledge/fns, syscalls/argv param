Parameter syntax: char *const argv[] = "array of constant pointers to strings". It's how Unix passes command arguments. Each string is an argument: ["ls", "-l", NULL]


argv: 
confusing syntax (char *const []){"ls", NULL} 
is just C's way of creating an array on the spot. 

It's equivalent to:
char *args[] = {"ls", NULL};
The NULL terminator is required by execvp().
