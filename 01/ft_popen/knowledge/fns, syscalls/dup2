dup2() creates COPIES, not moves.
c// Before dup2():
// fd 0 (stdin) → keyboard
// fd 3 (pipe read end) → pipe

dup2(fds[0], STDIN_FILENO);  // dup2(3, 0)

// After dup2():
// fd 0 (stdin) → pipe  ✓ (NEW copy pointing to pipe)
// fd 3 (pipe read end) → pipe  ✓ (ORIGINAL still exists)
Now you have TWO file descriptors pointing to the same pipe! That's why we close the originals - cleanup duplicate references.
