File descriptor array - KEY INSIGHT:
pipe() creates two connected file descriptors:

fds[0] - read end
fds[1] - write end
They're connected: write to fds[1], read from fds[0]

Mental model: Think of a physical pipe. Water goes in one end, comes out the other. fds[1] is the input end, fds[0] is the output end.
